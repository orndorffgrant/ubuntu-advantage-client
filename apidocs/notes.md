Desirable properties
* structured
* pretty
* easy to add endpoints and examples
* open source
* result is publishable as static files
* not hacky (doesn't overly abuse http specific stuff)

## Swagger UI
* uses openapi3
* requires http verbs (ignores if its invalid)

## Redoc
* uses openapi3
* requires http verbs (ignores if its invalid)

## Slate
* markdown extension
* main benefit is tabbed code examples and 3 column layout
